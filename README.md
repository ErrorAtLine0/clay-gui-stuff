# clay-gui-stuff
C++ Helpers used to make a GUI in clay (https://github.com/nicbarker/clay)

The code doesn't work as is, it's just put up for reference.

Filepicker gui code is located in Toolbar.cpp, in the function file_picker_gui().
Color picker code is located in GUIStuff/Elements/ColorPicker.hpp

Toolbar.cpp defines the actual GUI used in my program's code, while GUIStuff contains the helpers used to make that GUI.
